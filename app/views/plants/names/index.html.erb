<p>The Australian Plant Name Index (APNI) is a resource for the botanical community
that deals with vascular plant names and their usage in the scientific literature,
whether as a current name or synonym.  Names of cultivars derived from the
Australian flora are also included.
</p>
<p>
APNI does not recommend any particular taxonomy or nomenclature.
</p>

vascular flora, use the

<p>
APNI is a national resource that deals with native and naturalised
Australian plant names and their usage in the scientific literature,
whether as a current name or synonym. APNI does not recommend any particular
taxonomy or nomenclature. For a listing of currently accepted scientific names
for the Australian vascular flora, see the Australian Plant Census (APC).

<p>
Information available from APNI includes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Scientific plant names;

  <li>
    Author details;
  </li>
  <li>
    Original publication details (protologue) with electronic links to the publication when available;
  </li>
  <li>

<p>
  More recently APNI has begun to include other information, such as names
  registered by the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority (ACRA). For
  historical reasons APNI also currently includes names for hepatic’s. 
</p>
<p>
  APNI is currently maintained at the Centre for Australian National
  Biodiversity Research with staff, resources and financial support from the
  Australian National Herbarium, Australian National Botanic Gardens and the
  Australian Biological Resources Study. The CANBR, ANBG and ABRS collaborate
  to further the updating and delivery of APNI and APC.
