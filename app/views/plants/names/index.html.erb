<p>The Australian Plant Name Index (APNI) is a resource for the botanical community
that deals with vascular plant names and their usage in the scientific literature,
whether as a current name or synonym.  Names of cultivars derived from the
Australian flora are also included.
</p>
<p>
APNI does not recommend any particular taxonomy or nomenclature.
