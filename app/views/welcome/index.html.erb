    <p>The National Species List is a resource of names, accepted, and other
       taxonomies for Australian native and naturalised taxa.
    </p>

    <p>Its current focus is on the names and taxonomies covered by the
       International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants (ICN)
       and the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN).
    </p>

    <p>The infrastructure for searching across these domains is currently in
       development.
    </p>

    <p>As names and taxonomic lists are made available in the NSL they will be available here.

    The scope of names and taxonomies in this part of the National Species
    List are those covered by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae,
    fungi, and plants (ICN). The infrastructure for searching across this
    domain is currently in development.
    </p>

    <p>
    As names and taxonomic lists applicable to ICN are made available they will be available here.

    <%= link_to("Vascular Plants", plants_path) %>
</p>

    <p>
The scope of names and taxonomies in this part of the National Species List are the vascular plants, ferns and gymnosperms. Currently, for historical reasons hornworts and liverworts are also included but they are to moved to the appropriate taxonomic grouping.

    <p>
Names are recorded in the Australian Plant Name Index (APNI).
</p>
    <p>
The accepted taxonomy for Australian plants is recorded in the Australian Plant Census (APC)
</p>
    <p>
As other taxonomic lists are included in the NSL infrastructure they will also be available here.

APNI (https://biodiversity.org.au/test-nsl/search/plants/names)
</p>
    <p>
APNI is a national resource that deals with native and naturalised Australian plant names and their usage in the scientific literature, whether as a current name or synonym. APNI does not recommend any particular taxonomy or nomenclature. For a listing of currently accepted scientific names for the Australian vascular flora, see the Australian Plant Census (APC). 
</p>
    <p>
Information available from APNI includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Scientific plant names;
  </li>
  <li>
    Author details;
  </li>
  <li>
    Original publication details (protologue) with electronic links to the publication when available;
  </li>
  <li>
    Subsequent usage of the name in the scientific literature (in an Australian context)
  </li>
  <li>
    Typification details;
  </li>
  <li>
    An APC-tick-icon  showing which, if any, is the currently accepted concept in APC
  </li>
  <li>
    State distribution (from the Australian Plant Census (APC));
  </li>
  <li>
    Relevant comments and notes;
  </li>
  <li>
    Links to other information such as plant distributions, descriptions and images where available.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
More recently APNI has begun to include other information, such as names registered by the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority (ACRA). For historical reasons APNI also currently includes names for hepatic’s. 
</p>
<p>
APNI is currently maintained at the Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research with staff, resources and financial support from the Australian National Herbarium, Australian National Botanic Gardens and the Australian Biological Resources Study. The CANBR, ANBG and ABRS collaborate to further the updating and delivery of APNI and APC.

<p>
The Australian Plant Census (APC) is a list of the accepted scientific names for the Australian vascular flora, ferns and gymnosperms, both native and introduced, and lists synonyms and misapplications for these names. Currently, for historical reasons hornworts and liverworts are also included but they are to moved to the appropriate taxonomic grouping.
</p>
<p>
APC covers all published scientific plant names used in an Australian context in the taxonomic literature, but excludes taxa (including cultivars) known only from cultivation in Australia. The taxonomy and nomenclature adopted for the APC are endorsed by the Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria (CHAH).
</p>
<p>
For further information about names listed in APC, including bibliographic information, secondary references and typification, consult the Australian Plant Name Index (APNI). 
</p>
<p>
Information available through APC includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Accepted scientific name and author abbreviation(s);
  </li>
  <li>
    Reference to the taxonomic and nomenclatural concept adopted for APC;
  </li>
  <li>
    Synonym(s) and misapplications;
  </li>
  <li>
    State distribution, unless specifically labelled “(naturalised)” the taxon is considered to be native in each area listed;
  </li>
  <li>
    Relevant comments and notes
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
   In APC a CHAH reference indicates that the concept adopted for the APC has not been formally published elsewhere in a scientific work. In cases where a satisfactory circumscription or full synonymy does not exist, the APC Working Group and CHAH reach a consensus on the concept to be used.
</p>
<p>
Commentary arising from the APC project’s consideration of a name may be included. Comments are explanatory text on issues such as nomenclature, taxonomic concepts, hybrids and geographic occurrence.
</p>
<p>
APC is coordinated through a network of contributors, and is maintained by the Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research with staff, resources and financial support from the Australian National Herbarium, Australian National Botanic Gardens, Australian Biological Resources Study, CHAH and State and Territory herbaria. These organisations collaborate to further the updating and delivery of APC.
